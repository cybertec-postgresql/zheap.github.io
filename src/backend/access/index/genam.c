 *		general access method routines
 *
 *		All indexed access methods use an identical scan structure.
 *		We don't know how the various AMs do locking, however, so we don't
 *		do anything about that here.
 *
 *		The intent is that an AM implementor will define a beginscan routine
 *		that calls RelationGetIndexScan, to fill in the scan, and then does
 *		whatever kind of locking he wants.
 *
 *		At the end of a scan, the AM's endscan routine undoes the locking,
 *		but does *not* call IndexScanEnd --- the higher-level index_endscan
 *		routine does that.  (We can't do it in the AM because index_endscan
 *		still needs to touch the IndexScanDesc after calling the AM.)
 *
 *		Because of this, the AM does not have a choice whether to call
 *		RelationGetIndexScan or not; its beginscan routine must return an
 *		object made by RelationGetIndexScan.  This is kinda ugly but not
 *		worth cleaning up now.

 * Returns how many blocks should be considered favorable/contiguous for a

 *
 * There is always at least one favorable block during bottom-up index
 * deletion.  In the worst case (i.e. with totally random heap blocks) the
 * first block in line (the only favorable block) can be thought of as a
 * degenerate array of contiguous blocks that consists of a single block.
 * heap_index_delete_tuples() will expect this.
 *
 * Caller passes blockgroups, a description of the final order that deltids
 * will be sorted in for heap_index_delete_tuples() bottom-up index deletion
 * processing.  Note that deltids need not actually be sorted just yet (caller
 * only passes deltids to us so that we can interpret blockgroups).
 *
 * You might guess that the existence of contiguous blocks cannot matter much,
 * since in general the main factor that determines which blocks we visit is
 * the number of promising TIDs, which is a fixed hint from the index AM.
 * We're not really targeting the general case, though -- the actual goal is
 * to adapt our behavior to a wide variety of naturally occurring conditions.
 * The effects of most of the heuristics we apply are only noticeable in the
 * aggregate, over time and across many _related_ bottom-up index deletion
 * passes.
 *
 * Deeming certain blocks favorable allows heapam to recognize and adapt to
 * workloads where heap blocks visited during bottom-up index deletion can be
 * accessed contiguously, in the sense that each newly visited block is the
 * neighbor of the block that bottom-up deletion just finished processing (or
 * close enough to it).  It will likely be cheaper to access more favorable
 * blocks sooner rather than later (e.g. in this pass, not across a series of
 * related bottom-up passes).  Either way it is probably only a matter of time
 * (or a matter of further correlated version churn) before all blocks that
 * appear together as a single large batch of favorable blocks get accessed by
 * _some_ bottom-up pass.  Large batches of favorable blocks tend to either
 * appear almost constantly or not even once (it all depends on per-index
 * workload characteristics).
 *
 * Note that the blockgroups sort order applies a power-of-two bucketing
 * scheme that creates opportunities for contiguous groups of blocks to get
 * batched together, at least with workloads that are naturally amenable to
 * being driven by heap block locality.  This doesn't just enhance the spatial
 * locality of bottom-up heap block processing in the obvious way.  It also
 * enables temporal locality of access, since sorting by heap block number
 * naturally tends to make the bottom-up processing order deterministic.
 *
 * Consider the following example to get a sense of how temporal locality
 * might matter: There is a heap relation with several indexes, each of which
 * is low to medium cardinality.  It is subject to constant non-HOT updates.
 * The updates are skewed (in one part of the primary key, perhaps).  None of
 * the indexes are logically modified by the UPDATE statements (if they were
 * then bottom-up index deletion would not be triggered in the first place).
 * Naturally, each new round of index tuples (for each heap tuple that gets a
 * heap_update() call) will have the same heap TID in each and every index.
 * Since these indexes are low cardinality and never get logically modified,
 * heapam processing during bottom-up deletion passes will access heap blocks
 * in approximately sequential order.  Temporal locality of access occurs due
 * to bottom-up deletion passes behaving very similarly across each of the
 * indexes at any given moment.  This keeps the number of buffer misses needed
 * to visit heap blocks to a minimum.

 *
 *		These functions support system catalog accesses that normally use

 *		if the system indexes are unavailable.
 *
 *		The specified scan keys must be compatible with the named index.
 *		Generally this means that they must constrain either all columns
 *		of the index, or the first K columns of an N-column index.
 *
 *		These routines could work with non-system tables, actually,
 *		but they're only useful when there is a known index to use with
 *		the given scan keys; so in practice they're only good for
 *		predetermined types of scans of system catalogs.
